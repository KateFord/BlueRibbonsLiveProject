# Blue Ribbons Live Project
<p>An ASP.NET MVC project using Entity Framework design and Code First architecture. I collaborated as part of a team on a live project at The Tech Academy</p>

<p>This folder includes files I personally modified to enhance the Blue Ribbons Review website, a live site which allows Amazon sellers to offer selected merchandise at a discount in exchange for a product review. I was unable to include the entire solution as the site is propriety.</p>
