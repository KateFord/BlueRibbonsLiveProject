# Blue Ribbons Live Project
<p>An ASP.NET MVC project using Entity Framework design and Code First architecture. I collaborated as part of a team on a live project at The Tech Academy</p>

<p>This folder includes files I personally modified to enhance the Blue Ribbons Review website, a live site which allows Amazon sellers to offer selected merchandise at a discount in exchange for a product review. I was unable to include the entire solution as the site is propriety.</p>

<p>Please compare the files to view the changes I made during the 2 week sprint. Most files have two versions, the first being the original state prior to my contributions and the second at the conclusion of my time on the project. New files have only one version.</p>
