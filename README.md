# Live Project at The Tech Academy

## Introduction
For my final project at The Tech Academy, I worked with a development team of fellow students on a full-scale ASP.NET MVC Amazon Buying/Selling Web application in C#. The project use Entity Framework design and Code First architecture. It was a fantastic opportunity to take on legacy code, fix bugs, and add features. I saw first-hand how a web application evolves necessitating the removal or change to code added by previous developers. Under an excellent project manager, we worked together as a team, navigation issues as they presented themselves. During the two-week project, I worked on both front and back end user stories, really enjoying the challenges presented. The two week sprint definitely put my skills to the test and although it was challenging working on a project that many students have modified, plus having the responsibilites as a team member, I thoroughly enjoyed the Live Project and I gained a great deal of confidence in my abilities. 

## My Contributions
This folder includes files I personally modified to enhance the web application, a live site which allows Amazon sellers to offer selected merchandise at a discount in exchange for a product review. I was unable to include the entire solution as the site is propriety.

Please compare the files to view the changes I made during the 2 week sprint. Most files have two versions, the first being the original state prior to my contributions and the second at the conclusion of my time on the project. New files have only one version.
